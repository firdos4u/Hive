Hi guys! Here we are going to learn how to create buckets in Hive.For this, we are going to create Hive Bucket table 
which contains mark obtained by students.
We have input data in text file format which contains id,Name and mark of student. 

Step1.
Create a temporary table or normal table in Hive:

CREATE  TABLE marks_temp(
id INT,
Name string,
mark int
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';

Step2. Load data into above table from text file which is present in local path. You can get this file in the folder named as inputdata:

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH 'Desktop/Data/inputdata.txt'
INTO TABLE  marks_temp;

step3.
Now, we will create a bucketed table named as 'marks_bucketed'. We will create 4 buckets on id :

CREATE TABLE marks_bucketed(
id INT,
Name string,
mark int
)
CLUSTERED BY (id) INTO 4 BUCKETS;

step4. 
By default, in Hive bucketing is disabled. To enable it, we need to set 'hive.enforce.bucketing' as true.

set hive.enforce.bucketing=true;

step5.
Now, we can insert data from marks_temp ti marks_bucketed table

INSERT INTO marks_bucketed
SELECT id,Name, mark FROM marks_temp;

After this, one mapreduce job will run. In this job, No.of reducer will same as no. of buckets we are going to create in table.
In our case no. of reducer will be 4.
After successfull completion of job, we can see buckets from file browser(for me it is Hue as I am using Cloudera).
